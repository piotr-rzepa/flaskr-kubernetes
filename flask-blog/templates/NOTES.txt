4. To visit the Kibana dashboard, run command to forward the traffic to your local host:
  export KIBANA_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].port}" services {{ include "efk.kibanaName" .Subcharts.efk }})
  kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "efk.kibanaName" .Subcharts.efk }} $KIBANA_PORT:5601 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

5. Visit localhost:5601 on your local browser to access Kibana. There are no credentials required, since the access to Elasticsearch cluster is set to anonymous.

6. Go to Stack management -> Data Views (Under Kibana section) and create a new data view. You should see a single source of data called "fluentd". Create a data view by specifying a name and index pattern, which would match the "fluentd" source.

7. Now you can go to Analytics -> Discover section and see all your Fluentd logs being visualized on Kibana Dashboard
